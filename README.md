# exercise-tracker

## V1 Features

Track exercises within a mesocycle by laying out the plan for a week then auto-populating exercises for a new week; they should just be copied from the correct day in the previous week. 

Then we will add the ability to plan several weeks ahead within a mesocycle. 

We need the ability to list multiple mesocycles and group them into a program. 

## Implementation details

A rust server serving up a Bootstrap JS website; we will use some simple database for storing database. Would a document store be best for storing the data?
